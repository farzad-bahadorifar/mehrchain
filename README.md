## 🌟 Our Philosophy

In a world filled with chaos, it's easy to feel helpless. MehrChain is built on the belief that **value isn't just found; it's created.**

* **Be the Spark:** Inspired by Rumi's poetry, we believe change starts from within. You don't need to wait for the world to change; you light your own lamp first.
* **Chain Effects:** Every small positive act—whether reading a page, watering a plant, or helping a neighbor—creates a chain effect. We help you visualize these chains.
* **Passion over Pressure:** We are not a strict drill sergeant. We are a supportive companion. Growth should feel like a plant reaching for the sun, not a stone being pushed up a hill.

## 🗺️ The Vision

MehrChain is evolving from a simple habit tracker into a **DeSoc (Decentralized Social) Ecosystem** for social good.

1.  **Phase 1: The Inner Spark (Current Focus)**
    * A seamless, single-player experience.
    * **Guest-First:** No login walls. Start your journey immediately.
    * **Mero:** Our mascot that reacts to your consistency.
    * **PWA:** Installable on any device, independent of app stores.

2.  **Phase 2: The Social Nudge**
    * Share your "Journey" publicly.
    * Friends can "nudge" (encourage) your goals without toxic competition.

3.  **Phase 3: The Economy of Good**
    * A "Proof-of-Support" mechanism where the community creates value.
    * Patronage system for funding real-world positive impacts using Crypto.
