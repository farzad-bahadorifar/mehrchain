## 🤝 Call for Contributors

**Are you a Backend Developer or a Full-stack Engineer?**

We have built a beautiful, functional Frontend PWA using the latest Angular features. Now, we need to bring it to life with a real backend.

We are looking for contributors who can help with:
1.  **Setting up NestJS:** Initializing the backend structure.
2.  **Database Design:** Designing the schema for Users, Commitments, and Journey logs using PostgreSQL & Prisma.
3.  **API Development:** Creating RESTful APIs to replace our frontend mock services.

If you are passionate about building mindful technology and want to work with a modern stack, please open an Issue or submit a Pull Request!
